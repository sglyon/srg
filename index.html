    This goal of this paper is to better understand how firm entry and exit interact with aggregate productivity growth.
Empirical finding The authors main empirical finding is that the contribution to aggregate productivity growth from new firms is larger in periods of high productivity growth than in periods of low productivity growth.
This finding is established using data on all manufacturing plants in Chile from 1995 to 2006 and in Korea for 1992-1997, 2001-2006, and 2009-2014.

    The goal of this paper is to use the modeling concept of Global value chains to analyze the international impact of a lowering of trade costs.
Model Most of the paper is about describing the model. It is too complicated to explain in full in just 5 minutes, so I will discuss some of the key features so we can understand the results.
The model is static.
There are N countries that are symmetric in technology, but will have different parameter values in the calibrated model.

    The goal of this paper is to supply a theory that can shed light on what determines both the actual degree of tax progressivity in the US economy as well as a theoretical optimal level of tax progressivity.
Tax function The tax function used in this paper comes from Benabou (2002) and is log linear in income. That is taxes collected gross income, minus λ times gross income to the 1 − τ.

    The goal of this paper is to quantify the welfare implications of opening to trade in a setting where trade increases aggregate income, but also increases income inequality. Furthermore, redistribution happens through distorting income taxes.
Closed economy model Discrete time, infinite horizon.
A continuum of consumers, each with GHH preferences over an aggregate consumption good and labor. Individuals are indexed by their ability to produce a certain variety or task (unique to each consumer).

    Here Ljungqvist and Sargent explain both sides of a long debated issue regarding labor supply elasticity (percent change in labor supply divided by percent change in wages) and then describe a relatively new idea that has the potential to reconcile the opposing views. The main argument from the micro-and-labor-economics camp is that the labor supply elasticity is quite low for individuals in the work force. On the other hand, macroeconomists typically say that the aggregate labor supply elasticity is large.

    Empirical paper that tries to determine labor market response to China trade shock at the individual level. It is a complement to the authors' China Syndrome paper that answers similar questions at the regional level.
Stylized facts To prompt their research, the authors list a number of recent stylized facts concerning China's impact on US labor markets. They are that greater import exposure results in
 Higher rates of plant exit and more rapid declines in plant employment Larger decreases in manufacturing employment Increases in unemployment and labor force non-participation rates  These facts have been verified or reproduced at the industry and regional level, but the gap that this paper seeks to fill is what are the associated facts at the individual level.

    This is a purely empirical paper that tries to determine the degree to which there was worker relocation across regions in the US in response to the Chinese trade shock.
Many recent papers have documented negative regional labor market consequences in regions that specialize in industries that are more exposed to Chinese trade competition. Among these results are higher unemployment, lower wages, and lower labor force participation rates. Furthermore, evidence has been presented showing that there was little to no contemporaneous worker migration out of exposed regions.

    This paper develops a model that allows the authors to assess the aggregate gains from trade and the distribution of the gains from trade across groups of workers.
The motivation for the paper came from a recognition that most empirical work focuses on the losses accrued on the import side from increased competition. The general equilibrium setup in this paper captures both import and export effects of trade shocks, which they use to paint a more complete picture of the distribution of welfare responses to trade exposure.

    Review paper that summarizes the main points of the story behind China's fantastic growth in export markets in the lats 30 years and how it has impacted labor markets of developed countries.
This paper covers a width breadth of material in relatively little depth, so I will pick and choose from the main points they tried to make.
The story  Mao Zedong founded People's republic of China and governed it as the chairman of the communist part of China from 1949 until his death in 1976.
