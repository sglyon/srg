Data The goal of this paper is to use firm-level data to determine the determinants of productivity and output growth.
To do this, the authors use a nearly-balanced panel from 1987-1994 on 527 of the fortune 1000 firms to attempt to estimate the impact on investment in computers on output and productivity growth. This panel is a merging of compustat data with data from the Computer Intelligence InfoCorp, or CII.</description>

      <description>1 Intro  IN RECENT DECADES, INTANGIBLE capital has become an increasingly important factor of production. In many instances, such intangible capital is embodied in the firm’s key employees. We refer to this type of intangible capital as organization capital and develop a structural model to analyze its effect on asset prices. We argue that shareholders consider firms with high levels of organization capital to be riskier than firms with more physical capital, and provide empirical evidence supporting this claim.</description>
