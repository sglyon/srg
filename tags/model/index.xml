      <description>1 Intro  IN RECENT DECADES, INTANGIBLE capital has become an increasingly important factor of production. In many instances, such intangible capital is embodied in the firm’s key employees. We refer to this type of intangible capital as organization capital and develop a structural model to analyze its effect on asset prices. We argue that shareholders consider firms with high levels of organization capital to be riskier than firms with more physical capital, and provide empirical evidence supporting this claim.</description>
